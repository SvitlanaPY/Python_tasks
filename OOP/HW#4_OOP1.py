# 2. Create a child class Bus that will inherit all of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class
# and will have seating_capacity own method
class Vehicle:

# OUTPUT: red 85 500 120 400 50


# 7. Polymorphism: Create two classes: Bear, Wolf. Both of them should have make_sound method. Create two instances, one of Bear and one of Wolf, make a tuple of it and by using for call their action using the same method.
class Bear:

b_w = (bear, wolf)
for elem in b_w:
    elem.make_sound()
# OUTPUT: RRRRRRRRR
# OUTPUT: Woooooooo


# MAGIC METHODS:
# 8. Create class City with name, population instance attributes, return a new instance only when population > 1500,
# otherwise return message: "Your city is too small".
class City:
     def __new__(cls, name, population):
        if population > 1500:
            return super().__new__(cls)
        else:
            print("Your city is too small")

     def __init__(self, name, population):

w = City('City1', 1000)
print(w)
# OUTPUT: Your city is too small; None (no new object returned)
W = City('City2', 10000)
print(W)
# OUTPUT: <__main__.City object at 0x7f4dfb86a760>


# 9. Override a printable string representation of the City class and return: The population of the city {name} is {population}
class City:
    def __init__(self, name, population):
        self.name = name
        self.population = population

c = City('City3', 1000000)
print(c)
# OUTPUT: The population of the city City3 is 1000000


# 10*. Override magic method __add__() to perform the additional action as 'multiply' (*) the value which is greater than 10. And perform this add (+) of two instances.
class Dodavannya:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __add__(self, other):   # self = a1, other = a2
        if other.value > 10 or self.value > 10:    # other.value = a2.value (attribute of the second object a2); self.value = a1.value
            return other.value * self.value
        else:
            return other.value + self.value


a1 = Dodavannya(11)
a2 = Dodavannya(7)
print(a1 + a2)
# OUTPUT: 77
b1 = Dodavannya(5)
b2 = Dodavannya(3)
print(b1 + b2)
# OUTPUT: 8


# 11. The __call__ method enables Python programmers to write classes where the instances behave like functions and can be called like a function.
# Create a new class with __call__ method and define this call to return sum.
# (1)
class SumNumb:
    def __call__(self, *args):
        summa = 0
        summa = sum(args)
        return summa

print(s(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5))
# OUTPUT: 20


# (2)
class SumNumb:
    def __call__(self, *args):
        summa = 0
        for i in args:
            summa += i
        return summa

s = SumNumb()
print(s(1, 2, 3))
print(s(1, 2, 3))
# OUTPUT: 6 6


# 12*. Making Your Objects Truthy or Falsey Using __bool__().
# Create class MyOrder with cart and customer instance attributes. Override the __bool__magic method considered to be truthy if the length of the cart list is non-zero.
class MyOrder:
    def __init__(self, cart=[], customer=''):
        self.cart = cart
        self.customer = customer

    def __bool__(self):
        if len(self.cart) != 0:
            return True
        else:
            return False


order_1 = MyOrder(['a', 'b', 'c'], 'd')
order_2 = MyOrder([], 'a')
print(bool(order_1))
# OUTPUT: True
print(bool(order_2))
# OUTPUT: False
